# ControlNet Playground
The supporting repository for all things controlnet. Contains tutorials:

1. Living room remodeller - a model that uses semantic segmentation and canny edge detection to take an input of a room and generate what it thinks your living room should look like, based on a prompt. Check out this post for details of what this does: https://hutsons-hacks.info/using-controlnet-models-to-remodel-my-living-room
2. Doodle face - a model to take a profile picture and convert into your favourite animated images and some historical figures. See the supporting post: https://hutsons-hacks.info/creating-doodles-with-hed-detection-and-controlnet:
